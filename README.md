# data - package manager for datasets

Imagine installing datasets like this:

    data get jbenet/norb

It's about time we used all we've learned making package managers to fix the
awful data management problem. Read the [designdoc](dev/designdoc.md) and
the [roadmap](dev/roadmap.md).

## Install

Two ways to install:
- [from pre-built binary distributions](http://datadex.io/doc/install) (the easy way)
- [from source](http://datadex.io/doc/source-install) (the hard way)

## Usage

Please see the [command reference](http://datadex.io/doc/ref).

### Downloading datasets

Downloading datasets is trivial:
```
> data get jbenet/mnist
Installed jbenet/mnist@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/mnist@1.0
```

### Add datasets to projects

Or, if you want to add datasets to a project, create a Datafile like this one:
```
> cat Datafile
dependencies:
- jbenet/mnist@1.0
- jbenet/cifar-10
- jbenet/cifar-100
```

Then, run `data get` to install the dependencies (it works like `npm install`):
```
> data get
Installed jbenet/mnist@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/mnist@1.0
Installed jbenet/cifar-10@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/cifar-10@1.0
Installed jbenet/cifar-100@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/cifar-100@1.0
```

You can even commit the Datafile to version control, so your collaborators or users can easily get the data:
```
> git clone github.com/jbenet/ml-vision-comparisons
> cd ml-vision-comparisons
> data get
Installed jbenet/mnist@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/mnist@1.0
Installed jbenet/cifar-10@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/cifar-10@1.0
Installed jbenet/cifar-100@1.0 at datasets/jbenet/cifar-100@1.0
```

### Publishing datasets

Publishing datasets is simple:

1. make a directory with all the files you want to publish.
2. `cd` into it, and run `data publish` within the directory.
3. `data` will guide you through creating a Datafile.
4. Then, `data` will upload and publish the package.

```
> data publish
<lots of output>
Published jbenet/mnist@1.0 (b5f84c2).
```

Note that uploading can take a long while, as we'll upload all the files to S3, ensuring others can always get them.


## Datafile

data tracks the definition of dataset packages, and dependencies in a
`Datafile` (in the style of `Makefile`, `Vagrantfile`, `Procfile`, and
friends). Both published dataset packages, and regular projects use it.
In a way, your project defines a dataset made up of other datasets, like
`package.json` in `npm`.

```
# Datafile format
# A YAML (inc json) doc with the following keys:

# required
handle: <author>/<name>[.<format>][@<tag>]
title: Dataset Title

# optional functionality
dependencies: [<other dataset handles>]
formats: {<format> : <format url>}

# optional information
description: Text describing dataset.
repository: <repo url>
website: <dataset url>
license: <license url>
contributors: ["Author Name [<email>] [(url)]>", ...]
sources: [<source urls>]
```
May be outdated. See [datafile.go](datafile.go).

### why yaml?

YAML is much more readable than json. One of `data`'s [design goals
](https://github.com/jbenet/data/blob/master/dev/designdoc.md#design-goals)
is an Intuitive UX. Since the target users are scientists in various domains,
any extra syntax, parse errors, and other annoyances could cease to provide
the ease of use `data` aims for. I've always found this

```
dataset: feynman/spinning-plate-measurements
title: Measurements of Plate Rotation
contributors:
  - Richard Feynman <feynman@caltech.edu>
website: http://caltech.edu/~feynman/not-girls/plate-stuff/trial3
```

much more friendly and approachable than this

```
{
  "dataset": "feynman/spinning-plate-measurements",
  "title": "Measurements of Plate Rotation",
  "contributors": [
    "Richard Feynman <feynman@caltech.edu>"
  ],
  "website": "http://caltech.edu/~feynman/not-girls/plate-stuff/trial3"
}
```

It's already hard enough to get anyone to do anything. Don't add more hoops to
jump through than necessary. Each step will cause significant dropoff in
conversion funnels. (Remember, [Apple pays Amazon for 1-click buy](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/09/18Apple-Licenses-Amazon-com-1-Click-Patent-and-Trademark.html)...)

And, since YAML is a superset of json, you can do whatever you want.


## Development

Setup:

1. [install go](http://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Run

```
git clone https://github.com/jbenet/data
cd data
make deps
make install
```

You'll want to run [datadex](https://github.com/jbenet/datadex) too.

## About

This project started because data management is a massive problem in science.
It should be **trivial** to (a) find, (b) download, (c) track, (d) manage,
(e) re-format, (f) publish, (g) cite, and (h) collaborate on datasets. Data
management is a problem in other domains (engineering, civics, etc), and `data`
seeks to be general enough to be used with any kind of dataset, but the target
use case is saving scientists' time.

Many people agree we direly need the
"[GitHub for Science](http://static.benet.ai/t/github-for-science.md)";
scientific collaboration problems are large and numerous.
It is not entirely clear how, and in which order, to tackle these
challenges, or even how to drive adoption of solutions across fields. I think
simple and powerful tools can solve large problems neatly. Perhaps the best
way to tackle scientific collaboration is by decoupling interconnected
problems, and building simple tools to solve them. Over time, reliable
infrastructure can be built with these. git, github, and arxiv are great
examples to follow.

`data` is an attempt to solve the fairly self-contained issue of downloading,
publishing, and managing datasets. Let's take what computer scientists have
learned about version control and distributed collaboration on source code,
and apply it to the data management problem. Let's build new data tools and
infrastructure with the software engineering and systems design principles
that made git, apt, npm, and github successful.

### data publish

```
> data publish
==> Guided Data Package Publishing.

==> Step 1/3: Creating the package.
Verifying Datafile fields...
Generating manifest...
data manifest: added Datafile
data manifest: added data.csv
data manifest: added data.txt
data manifest: added data.xsl
data manifest: hashed 2183ea8 Datafile
data manifest: hashed 63443e4 data.csv
